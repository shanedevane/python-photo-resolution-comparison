Example: if a image conforms to the resolution of a common 'film' format
ie. 16:9 that image might be a screenshot from a video (instead of a photo
from a camera)

# PURPOSE & GOALS

## Purpose
To be a package within a bigger system. This is designed around extracting as much
image data from a photograph. As it's purpose is to aid in investigating 
correlations between image resolutions as part of image classification.

## Goal
To determine if the photo resolution of an image aids in classification.
